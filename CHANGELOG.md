# v2.0.0

## [v2.0.0] - 29-04-2025

### **Swift 2.0.0 is here — bringing new features, improvements, and refinements following the 2.0.0-beta** 🎉

Alongside the features introduced during the beta, this release adds support for new user management modules, separation of header navigation items, a simpler email concept, and general refinements to improve flexibility and consistency across Swift.
> [!NOTE]
> **Requirements**
>
> * **Swift v2.0.0 requires DynamicWeb v10.15 `*` or newer, if Shipmondo is used, it requires Shipmondo.dll version 10.0.5 (installed) or newer**
>

`* Swift v2.x does not run on DynamicWeb 9`

## New Users modules

Swift 2.0 supports new Users modules in Dynamicweb 10 as an replacement for the Extranet module.
The modules and new templates offer flexible handling with separate apps for login, user creation together with user- and address management.

* Users - Create User
* Users - Login
* Users - Recover Password
* Users - Edit User
* Users - View User
* Users - Manage Addresses
* Users - Change Password

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * The **Customer Center page** and the **Customer Center app** are no longer part of Swift 2.0.0. Instead, **regular Page** and the **App item type** are now used.
> * If you're not using the updated Swift database, you must **enable the new Users modules** from the Settings area:  **Administration > Feature Management > Enable new extranet apps** to be able to use and set this up.
>
> **Further improvements planned:**
>
> * Enhancing the **user experience (UX)** and **user interface (UI)** of the customer center features
> * The Manage user setup for invite and managing users, still use the Extranet app and will as well be replaced with the new Users modules alongside new user management features.
> * Option to use **System Emails** (Emails build in Visual Editor)
> * Continuing to add **user management features** and **settings** to the new Users modules.
>

## Improved Header Elements for Utility Navigation

Mini Cart, Sign In, My Account, Preferences and Favorites have been separated into **individual paragraphs**, instead of being part of the Navigation paragraph. This change makes layout and styling **simpler and more flexible**.

Benefits:

* Clear separation of functionality
* Lighter, easier-to-customize templates
* More flexible and independent layout options

## Simplified Email concept

The structure for setting up Emails has been simplified by removing header/footer together with the Email Settings page.

* **Emails now live inside a regular folder** under Pages, just like other content.
* **Note:** The **email paragraphs** themselves are for now unchanged compared to Swift 1.  
    Future improvements to email templates and design are planned.

### General improvements

**Color Scheme improvements**
Swift now help auto-name color schemes if none exist, ensuring **consistent naming**.
This makes it much easier to **switch or change color scheme collections** later.

**General Refinements**  
Various optimizations and adjustments across templates and features based on feedback from 2.0-beta.

> [!TIPS]
> * In website settings you can decide if you want to enable mini off-canvas and decide it's behaviour

The customer can easily navigate through the different product groups.

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/Files/Images/Swift/Product-group-grid.png)

### Related products using Product component slider
Use related products on the Product detail page to make customers aware of other available products. On Swift it is possible to use product components to build the related products. This allows you to decide, which information to show and align the design with your product list.

Furthermore, it is possible to decide, which of the related product groups should be shown on the section, when designing the product detail page.

DynamicWeb proudly presents Swift 1.22.0 (Q2-2023), which runs on DW version 9.15.9. This introduce  Stock and CSS Swift tool, The main headlines for this release are:

## Present proper information for the visitors

### Anchor links
On a CTA buttons we introduce anchor links, which can link to another location either on the same page or another page. This helps the visitors to jump to a specific area, without scrolling too much and gives the visitor the proper information immediately. 

### Related articles

* Article category 
* Article collection tags

## Google Analytics & Tag Manager - Tracking 

Google Analytics 4 and Google Tag Manager are supported in Swift, which will enable you to see e.g. Monetization on E-commerce purchases, Engagement events & conversions. Tracking is enabled when accepting DynamicWeb's cookie manager. However, when using a third party cookie manager this could sometimes be an issue.
Swift has reimplemented how cookies and tracking scripts are handled. When the Dynamicweb Cookie manager is disabled, Swift will allow tracking (this is changed compared to previous versions) which makes it possible to use Google Tag manager to inject external cookie scripts like Cookie Information and Cookiebot and let them handle when and how Analytics are loaded and how client side cookies are handled.

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com//Files/Images/Swift/Cookie-manager.png)


**Info**
* When using a third party cookie manager you can disable DynamicWeb's cookie manager under Settings / Web Http / Cookie Manager

## Inventories & Stock notifications
On the product detail page, product inventory can be an important information to show to the visitors, to let them know that the product is in stock. With this information we have extended som extra functionalities such as Stock state, Back in stock notifications email, Stock location overview. 

### Stock state
The labels on the Stock state were predefined in Swift. However, we now support the Stock State in DynamicWeb, where you can define your own labels on the stock levels based on its stock state. This allows you to provide your own message to the visitors. An addition to that it is possible to hide inventory number from stock component and only show the stock state label

* Create own labels based on stock levels
* Inform your visitor how many items that are left


![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com//Files/Images/Swift/Stock-states.png)


### Back in Stock notifications

Notify the visitors when a product is back in stock with the back in stock notification component. This aims to sustain the initial visitors interest by coming back to the website and purchase the item, because it enables an alert and expectation of that the items will be restocked in the future.

* Aims to sustain the initial visitors interest
* With the back in stock notification you can create and design a system email and notify the visitors through email Marketing

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com//Files/Images/Swift/Back-in-stock-notification.png)


### Stock location overview

Companies with multiple stock locations can now be presented in Swift. With the Stock location component
 it is possible for the visitors to get an overview over where the item is in Stock. 

* See if the item is in stock
* An overview over where the item is available
* Search for a specific location based on Location name and address

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/Files/Images/Swift/Stock-locations-overview-1.png)


## Stand out with CSS Swift tool

Do you want to add your own design to standard? With Swift CSS tool you can add the customers design on the commerce projects. This can be done by adding Class name and CSS code through the Swift CSS tool concept, where the css code can be reused. This offers developers to add some ' decorations ' e.g. rounded corners, shadows or use standard bootstrap utilities on top of our standard elements.

* Add CSS without editing the Swift standard item types
* Make the CSS globally and reuse the code
* Part 1: Basic functionlity implmented on row and TextAdvanced
* Part 2: Micro templates + all relevant paragraphs (Upcoming)

**Database - with demo data:** 
* This database includes all the Swift content pages and ecommerce products data

**Database - with no ecommerce data:** 
* This database includes all the Swift content pages, but with no ecommerce data such as products, variants, related products. It is also been cleaned for Product fields and category fields and much more. *(Available the next couple of days)*

## Engage visitors with articles
Create your articles through Visual editor when creating news, blogs, campaigns etc. This is a way to **engage your visitors** with updates on the company, relatable stories and it is a **free marketing platform to promote products on the websites**.
As an addition to the articles we introduce Tags and Filtering, which can help **organise** the articles.  The **visitors can find the proper article they are looking for** through filters.

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/Files/Images/Swift/Articles-tags-filtering.png)

* Use article tag collection to create groups collection with tags. The tags can be added to one or multiple articles that can be displayed on the article list as a badge.
* Use filtering based on the tags collections or article list categories
* Possible to Enable the load more button together with page size to showcase a small chunk of articles at a time to give better overview and control over the page
* The article tag collection filter works for only 1 article list. Having multiple article lists on the pages is possible but the filter will effect on all of them.

### Changes on the article list
* The article list layout is changed in order to have the right placement for the tag badge
* The article list shows the article list as default. If you need to set it back to only show the Article category this is still possible

## Content & marketing

### Open Graph
Open graph was available on products and the general website. On  this release it is now possible to control the Open graph information on a specific content page. By deciding which image, title and description you want to display when sharing a link of your content page on social media e.g. LinkedIn, facebook etc. **Highlighting specific articles, events or campaigns on social media.**
* Open graph makes the links more visual, eye-catching and rich on the social media feeds

* Fill in the page meta data: image, title and description to enrich the Open graph information

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/Files/Images/Swift/Open-Graph.png)

### Custom fonts
Swift supports Google fonts. However, some branding websites want to use custom font on their websites that can define the brand and impression that the company wants to give. This allows you to have consistency across the different media and platforms

* Align the branding and design through the custom fonts throughout the website
* File extensions that are supported .tff, .woff, and .woff2 
* This is the *[Custom font setup guide](http://doc.dynamicweb.com/swift/setup-project/design/branding#sideNavTitle1-2-1)*

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/Files/Images/Swift/Custom-font.png)

### Google Tag Manager
Swift support Google Analytics 4, where the ecommerce events are supported. That will enable you to see e.g. Monetisation on E-commerce purchases, Engagement events & conversions. If you do not want to use Google Analytics 4 directly. You are now able to connect with Google Tag Manager that gives the ability to install different types of tags. Google Analytics 4 is the tracking tool, while Google Tag manager is the mediator between your website and the tracking tool.
* Possible to add, change update own tags as needed for conversion tracking, site analytics
* Tags help social marketers group and categorise posts for flexible reporting on content and campaigns
* The GTM id can be added in Website settings

## Visitors ask for flexibility

### Parcelshop - Shipmondo provider
In the checkout delivery step, it is now possible to offer Parcelshop delivery using Shipmondo.
Parcelshop offers customers to select a specific parcelshop store near them, where their package can be delivered to. **This benefit customers who are not at home for home delivery**. Shipment is quick and simple and it also benefit the extended opening hours, offered by the collection point.

* Use DynamicWeb shipping fee matrix to set up prices

![alt text](https://doc.dynamicweb.com/Files/Images/Swift/Shipmondo-deliverystep.png)

### Updated checkout flow
* In order to include parcel shop, we needed to change the cart flow. 
* New checkout templates are created marked as v2, since we needed to use customer info fields, instead of deliver info fields for e.g. anonymous users.
* The old templates still exist so it is still compatible if you are upgrading your Swift.
* But if you need to use Parcelshop in your solution this needs to be setup
* The new released database has already the setup for the new checkout flow

## Decrease implementation time 
Product component gives the flexibility to build own product list and product detail page through Visual editor, which can decrease the implementation time, since you can configure it yourself using the components. You can also create your own custom components using your own template together with the Swift product components.

### Additional elements for Product Component

* **Product name** - Possible to define h-tags. e.g. < h1 >, < h2 > 
* **Product image** - Possible to show alternative image on hover based on the assets category groups. this give a more dynamic look and feel when hovering over the product list

## System emails in visual editor
Build your email set up in Visual editor, when creating emails for your website when e.g. building emails for  create account and order receipt. This allows you edit your emails in an easy and visual manner and implement your own custom email elements.

### Mails created

* **Create account** and **verify mails** through extranet app
* **Invite users** send an invite user email trough the user area
* **Forgot password** - possible to send a reset a password mail, when a user has forgotten their code
* **Welcome email** - send through marketing email flow, so user can set a password on the new website
* **Order confirmation mail receipt**, set on cart app (still under developement)

The system emails are created and setup, but not selected on the different app module, we still run with the regular email setup.

## Reorder products
In customer center my order page, it is possible for customers reorder products from an earlier purchase. This is an easy way to let customer get the product they need, without any hassle and enhanced the customer experience. An addition to this reorder functionality, an extra step is added where users can get an overview over the order list for what is in stock, or if they want to add or edit the quantity before adding it to their cart.

## DW10 Conversion
Swift has rewritten the razor templates so it is suitable to run both DW9 and DW10. This gives the opportunity to keep working on Swift projects in the future. Going from DW9 (.NET 4) to DW10 (.NET 7) gives some issues on the templates, since some elements are deprecated. The focus has been on the code that is not easily converted trough the DW10 template converter. 

**Focus areas on Swift**
* Rewritten helpers are deprecated in Razor​
* System.web and HttpContext is deprecated in .NET 7
* Any use of .NET 4 framework only APIs is deprecated​
* New razor parser in .NET 7 with minor changes to execution

# v1.14.0
## [1.14.0] - 01-09-2022

Dynamicweb proudly presents Swift 1.14.0 (Q2-2022). This introduce Digital Assets Portal and Google Analytics 4, which can improve work process and possible to analyse and measure traffic on the website. The main headlines for this release are:

## Digital Assets Portal
Make the product assets and digital media assets available for download, which can help businesses to optimize their work process, by giving them a self-service website with downloadable product assets and media assets. 

### Includes these areas:
* **Digital Assets:** Possible to download media assets in different resolution that is not product related e.g. logo, employee images, guides, company events images 
* **Product Assets:** A product list overview where it is possible to use filter to help users to find the right product
* **Product Detail:** On the product detail page it is possible to download product assets for the chosen product
* **Download cart:** It is possible to collect multiple products to the download cart 
* **My orders:** Download product assets based on your orders in Customer center
* **Email:** A link will be send to one or more email addresses, where a zip file can be downloaded

A Dynamicweb license is needed, in order to use the download functionality
Remember to run update script from 1500, in order to receive newest ProductExportMail.cshtml from Dynamicweb, which is needed for receiving a mail with a download link. On existing solution delete the old ProductExportMail.cshtml which is not viewmodel base.

## Analyse and measure traffic with Google Analytics 4
* Google announced that Google Analytics 3 (Universal) will no longer be supported July 1st 2023. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) will take its place because of GDPR and Cookie issues in the current Google Analytics 3.
* Swift is releasing GA4, where the ecommerce events are supported. This will enable you to see e.g. **Monetisation on E-commerce purchases, Engagement events & conversions**
* GA4 gives you a more intelligent user privacy and tracking features, it gives users more intuitive and precise control over what personal data is collected, which is important to help your business comply with current and future privacy regulations.
* With GA4 you can analyse your ecommerce website, by measuring traffic and engagement across your websites. You will get simplified goals and events setup, which was a complex set up before regarding transactional functions such checkouts.
* Swift supports Debug view mode, enable the debug mode in website settings and you can debug real-time report that GA4 provides, track data immediately when testing on your website. (You need to be login in DW backend in order to use debug view mode for testing)

**General**
* Measurement ID is needed to use GA4, which is placed in website settings
* GA4 will be triggered when accepting All cookies or statistical cookies
* Here are the ecommerce events that are supported in Swift
https://doc.dynamicweb.com/swift/setup-project/guides/google-analytics-4

## Content marketing

### Content search
* Help visitors find what they are looking for on the website either products or content information. Content search can help visitors to quickly find new information about the company’s business e.g. through articles. 
* Swift has product search, but now content search is also available. Content search can be used together with the product search or by itself e.g. if you have a website that does not include ecommerce.

### Better Responsive behaviour
* Improve the visual presentation of your website on smaller devices.
* Define how your content elements should be placed: stacked, side by side. 
* Control spacing and padding and define which column what should be placed first.

## B2B solution

### Create & Manage users
* Easier way for Sales representative to create & manage customers. A sales rep. has the opportunity to create and manage users in Customer center
* This allows the Sales rep. to create new users in frontend, without logging in the backend administration. The sales rep. can get a list of customers that he/she has created and see an overview over who has accepted their invitation.
* This is a strong functionality that can be used together with impersonation, when a sales rep. can create an order on-behalf of their customers.

## GDPR, Compliance, Lighthouse score & Schema.org

### Google fonts
* Google hosted fonts can be violating the EU privacy regulation in some EU countries, i.e. Germany, therefore Google font is now downloaded and served from the solution.

### Alt text
* Add Alt text for images on content elements. Alt text is used for visitors that are unable to see the images on the website, but uses tool such as screen readers

### Heading level
* SEO requires there should always be a < h1 > on a content page. Define heading level on the content elements by settings h-tags e.g.  < h1 > < h2 >. As default we set < h2 >

### Schema.org
* Schema.org helps the search engine to better understand the info that is on the website, to have a more rich search result. Schema.org has been added for articles , employee and block quotes elements

## Improvements & Maintenance

### General
* **Clickable/non clickable menus:** support both for Content pages and Ecommerce groups
* **Deployment:** Improvements on the deployment set up, on how to deploy Swift on another solution. Read the guide here
https://doc.dynamicweb.com/swift/setup-project/guides/how-to-deploy-swift-to-another-solution#sideNavTitle1

### Design
* **Themes:** Button link is added and can be used on the content elements
* **Themes:** Accent colors is added. It is currently only supported for TextAdvanced content element (Support on the other content elements will come later)
* **Text and image:** possible to add 2 buttons

### Content
* **Related products:** Use Swiffy slider instead of tiny slider for related products slider
* **Product group slider:** On the front page or other regular content page possible to use Product group as a slider to have an easier way to access and promote product groups.
* **TextAdvanced:** New content element where you have advanced settings to control top/bottom, right/left padding, accent colors, font sizes for eyebrow, title and subtitle.

### Product detail
* Optimization on how Product page is rendered to make breadcrumb work optimal
* Possible to hide display group Title e.g. when using rich text for extra information

### Product components
* **Quote button component:** Possible to add directly to the quote cart from product detail page

### Checkout
* **Payment providers:** ChargeLogic, Cybersource and EbizCharge

### Email
* We no longer support the old Newsletter emails, instead use the improved Email concept.
* The new Email concept will also include designing System email on Visual editor, but this is still under development.

Dynamicweb proudly presents **Swift 1.10.0 (Q1-2022)** This introduce additional B2B functionalities to Swift, such as Quotes Other than that there has been a big focus on ways to decrease the implmentation time. The main headlines for this release are:

## B2B solution

In this release there is a focus on capabilities supporting especially requirements from B2B customers that are moving their sales to digital channels.

### Quotes & assisted selling

* A sales rep can easily find products through the webshop and gather an offering to a customer that is interested in collection of products using **quotes**. The customer can request quotes and can see a list of open quotes in the customer center and convert quotes to orders.

### Products
* Show a replacement product if a **product is discontinued** / temporarily or permanently unavailable. This will help the customer to easily find an alternative product to purchase and a potential sale is not lost.

* Show **selected product** group on your products list, this gives an overview over the product subgroups that can be visited and highlights different product groups and makes catalog navigation more explorative for larger catalogs.

### Checkout 
* During checkout **Google places Autocomplete** can be used, which suggests street addresses when typing , this helps the user to type in the proper address format and also gives a faster checkout flow and ensuring data quality.

## Decrease implementation time 

Based on feedback from partners and developers ,significant improvements have been made in 3 areas that almost always requires some kind of customization. The information in product lists, on the product detail pages and the content in emails being send, mostly needs some kind of modification to match customer requirements.
Usually this causes several code changes that drives cost and complexity.
By utilizing the visual content builder in new ways, a lot of these customizations can be avoided and minimized resulting in faster and cheaper implementations.


### Build emails with Visual Editor
* Swift presents a new email concept where you can build beautiful newsletter emails through visual editor and re-use content and product data in emails.
* The plan with the new Email concept is also to design **System emails** using the visual content builder. This allows the email editor to visually design the system emails such order email, create account emails etc. Before changes to emails has to be done by developers directly in the templates – with the new concept, content can be edited in the visual content builder. **Building system emails** will come later on

### Building blocks for product list and details 
* **Product component** it gives the flexibility to create own product list and product detail page, through Visual editor, which can decrease the implementation time since you can build own product list
* **Custom components** can be added easily and adopted in the visual content builder

### Digital Assets Portal
* Make your product assets and **product information visible and available for download.** This is to help business optimize their work process for distributing their product assets and product information
* User can browse and collect products needed in other systems and **download data in various formats** together with digital assets like photos, images, documents, and other files.
* Product data can be exported in different**formats like CSV, XML and JSON.** Images can be delivered in different formats and resolutions depending on what they need to be used for.
* (Digital Assets Portal functionality requires a Dynamicweb license)

* **Block quotes content element**  use for direct quotations e.g. quotes that benefits a company or the products that the company are selling 
* **Employee content element** - display the employee list on your website. Their name, title and contact information and promote who are behind the company.
