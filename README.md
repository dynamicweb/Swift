## Build styles and scripts (npm)

Swift uses npm to handle and compile styles and bundle scripts, assets and libraries. This means that the Swift design must be built after being cloned:

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the cloned `Swift`folder
3. Run `npm install` - to get all dependecies
4. Run `npm run build`- to compile and build all design styles, scripts and assets

## Requirements, Hosting environment and install

* **Swift v2.0.0-beta** requires **DynamicWeb version 10.12** and **Shipmondo dll v2.0.0** or newer, if Shipmondo is used, it requires **Shipmondo.dll version 10.0.5 (which needs to be installed) or newer**

* The baseline database is a bacpac file created using the Microsoft SQL Server 2016 standard (version SQL server 15.0.2080.9) using SQL Server Management Studio 2019 version 15.018040.0.
