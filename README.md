## Build styles and scripts (npm)

Swift uses npm to handle and compile styles and bundle scripts, assets and libraries. This means that the Swift design must be built after being cloned:

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the cloned `Swift`folder
3. Run `npm install` - to get all dependencies
4. Run `npm run build`- to compile and build all design styles, scripts and assets
