## âœ¨ New Features
### Styling Integrated into DynamicWeb Core
Key design elements such as color schemes, typography, and button styles, which were previously defined inside the Swift design, have now been integrated into DynamicWeb Core. This makes it easier to streamline styling across projects and reduces the complexity of managing design options.

### New Selectors in DynamicWeb 10

Swift 2 takes full advantage of the new Selectors in Dynamicweb Core, making it easier to configure content elements, buttons, links, and colors with an intuitive UI.

* Rich Text Editor â€“ Setting H-tags and heading size directly within the editor with style-supported typography, enhanced table support and new link selector.

* Image Selector â€“ Built-in aspect ratio with focal point for precise and flexible image cropping.

* Video Selector - Handles uploaded videos from assets or embedded video links from Vimeo and YouTube.

* Color Selector â€“ Visual selector for color scheme with preview background, text and button colors. 

* Button & Link Selector â€“ Seamlessly select pages, paragraphs, product groups, products and external links. Button selector including button text and style preview adapting to the chosen color scheme.

### âœ¨ A New Content Model
Swift 2 introduces a redesigned content model aimed at simplifying and standardizing content creation.

#### Reduced Editor Complexity
Many design options have been removed from the editor interface, ensuring a consistent design across the website. New editor toggles to control and hide unused options, providing a cleaner editing experience, reducing noise and clutter. 
Editors can now focus on creating content without being overwhelmed by numerous design configurations.

#### Row and Grid Enhancements
Row and grid definitions have been moved into DynamicWeb 10, making them easier to define and modify through the UI. Quality-of-life improvements include the ability to modify the layout of existing rows. Native support for colors, background images, and design options such as row width, size, and padding has been added.

#### Improved Technical Structure
Row definitions are now split into multiple files instead of a single file, making it easier to customize rows while remaining upgradable. A unified template for all rows simplifies maintenance and customization.

#### Simplified Templates
Paragraph layouts now use a simple, extendable template system. Customizing layouts no longer requires editing item types, enabling easier upgrades and reusability.

#### Reusability Across Projects
Layouts are stored as separate files, making them easy to copy and reuse across different projects.
