## âœ¨ New Features
### Styling Integrated into DynamicWeb Core
Key design elements such as **color schemes**, **typography**, and **button styles**, which were previously defined inside the Swift design, have now been integrated into DynamicWeb Core. This makes it easier to streamline styling across projects and reduces the complexity of managing design options.

#### Color Schemes
Define and align colors across the website directly in DynamicWeb Core.

### New UI Editors in DynamicWeb 10

Swift 2 takes full advantage of the new selectors in Dynamicweb Core, making it easier to configure content elements, buttons, links, and colors with an intuitive UI.

* **Button & Link Selector** â€“ Seamlessly select pages, paragraphs, product groups, products and external links. The button selector preview and button style adapts to the chosen color scheme.

* **Image Selector** â€“ Built-in aspect ratio with focal point for precise and flexible image cropping.

* **Video Selector** â€“ Handles uploaded videos from assets or embedded video links from Vimeo and YouTube.

* **Color Selector** â€“ Visual selector for color scheme with preview background, text and button colors. 

* **Rich Text** â€“ Setting H-tags and heading size directly within the editor with style-supported typography, enhanced table support and new link selector.

### âœ¨ A New Content Model
Swift 2 introduces a redesigned content model aimed at simplifying and standardizing content creation, improving both the editor and developer experience.

#### Reduced Editor Complexity
Many design options have been removed from the editor interface, ensuring a consistent design across the website. New editor toggles to control and hide unused options, providing a cleaner editing experience, reducing noise and clutter. 
Editors can now focus on creating content without being overwhelmed by numerous design configurations.

#### Row and Grid Enhancements
Swift 2 takes full advantage of the new row definitions in DynamicWeb 10, making it possible to create your own definitions through the UI, which will then be accessible in the Visual Editor. Supported features such as background image, row width, padding, gap settings and vertical alignment can easily be enabled for each row type. New row setting for desktop columns allows the Editor to easily and effortlessly change the row type for exisiting content. This makes it easier to manage page layouts, restructure content, and adapt pages to different design needs with minimal effort.

#### Improved Technical Structure
Row definitions are now split into multiple json files instead of a single file, making it easier to customize row definitions while remaining upgradable. A unified template for all rows simplifies maintenance and customization.

#### Simplified Templates
Paragraph layouts now use a simple, extendable template system. Customizing layouts no longer requires editing item types, enabling easier upgrades and reusability.
Layouts are stored as separate files, making them easy to copy and reuse across different projects.
