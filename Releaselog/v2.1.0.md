## Create Article-Style Content with Posts and Posts Lists
Swift now offers a streamlined way to structure and present article-style content using Posts and Posts Lists.

This feature allows editors to build flexible, visually engaging overviews — ideal for blogs, news sections, announcements, and other post-based content — using two methods tailored to different technical needs:

You can display lists of pages as posts using:

* Post List Paragraph – an intuitive, editor-friendly approach
* Query Publisher – a more advanced, query-based method for developers

### Method 1: Post List Paragraph
Designed for editors who prefer a visual, no-code experience, the Post List Paragraph makes it easy to display posts by selecting a layout and (optionally) a parent source page.

Key Benefits:
* Intuitive paragraph editor interface
* No coding required
* Layout-driven and flexible
* Ideal for landing pages, front pages, or section overviews

### Method 2: Query Publisher (Advanced)
For greater flexibility, the Query Publisher app lets developers filter and display posts using a query-based setup.

Use Cases:
* Advanced filtering or dynamic list generation
* Full control over layout via templates

> [!NOTE]
> * Both methods rely on a Posts index
> * The SEO → Image field defines the image shown in list views

### Categorize Your Posts
You can organize posts into categories using Swift’s folder structure. This makes it easy to manage and present content grouped by topic or section — useful for filtering and visual grouping in post overviews.
