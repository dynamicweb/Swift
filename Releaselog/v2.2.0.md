## Empowering self-service experience

We are excited to introduce the new Customer Center in Swift. A major upgrade of the design has been implemented and with the main focus on B2B users. 
Empowering the self-service experience when using the Customer center

A role-base acces has been set up that ensures users to see only what they need depending if you are a **B2B Customer, Account administrator or Customer Sales representative / Customer Support representative (CSR)**

- **B2B Customer** - the company that purchases products or services on behalf of its organization, often with company pricing, invoices, and approval flows.
- **Account Admin** - Managing the company account—users, roles, permissions
- **CSR** -The customer Sales/Support representative can support B2B customers by creating orders, managing accounts and users, negotiating pricing, and helping close and manage deals

### Orders
B2B orders are often high-value, multi-item, and handled by multiple stakeholders. This update is designed to give buyers, procurement teams, and account managers full transparency—before, during, and after purchase

### Carts
Carts in Customer center gives the flexibility to create, manage, and track several carts at the same time—each tailored to a specific need. B2B purchasing rarely fits into a single cart. Different departments, budgets, timelines, and approvers often require separation. With multiple carts, customers can now work the way their business actually operates

### Quotes
Business customers can  view, manage, and act on quotes directly in the Customer Center, making it easier to move from negotiation to purchase—without back-and-forth emails

### Saved cards / Wallet

To support faster and more efficient purchasing, we’ve added Saved Cards / Wallet to the Customer Center. B2B customers can now securely store and manage payment cards—such as Visa and credit cards—and reuse them across future orders

## Simplified Account management for Business customers

### Accounts
Sales Representatives can create Accounts and manage users directly from the Customer Center, making account setup faster and more efficient.

> [!NOTE]
> Further development of Accounts and managing users will continue, giving the possibility to invite users, resend invitations and activate/deactivate users directly on the list. 

> [!IMPORTANT]Accounts is still under feature flag, to enable the Account functionality go to Settings/ Administration / Feature management / Enable user account functionality

## Login External authentication

Users can now sign in using **external authentication providers** directly from the login screen (e.g. Microsoft Entra, Google etc.), making access faster, easier, and more secure
